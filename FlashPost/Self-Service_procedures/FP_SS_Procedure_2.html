<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Converting a customer already existing in FP into a 'Self-Service' one</span></h2>   
<p> You might come across a situation when the outbound partner needs to use the self-service feature but is not able to create the customer because that customer is already existing in FlashPost (it used to be FP customer in the past and/or they had postings to Appcast, Infojobs, or Daijob). </p>
<p>In order to import the credits for such a customer, you need <b>to choose the correct scenario and follow up the steps:</b></p>

<br> 

<p class="important"><i><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If the existing FP customer has a running set-up (a running wallet for other countries than Infojobs, Appcast, and/or Daijob), they should keep using the set-up and they should NOT be switched into self-service customer. Any new purchase for such a customer should be treated via the normal set-up and delegation process.</i></p>
<p class="important"><i><b>IMPORTANT:</b> We do describe the procedure for GFP credits below as well. However, GFP packages <b><u>should use the regular set-up </b></u>(FPRA or AFP) and only be used for self-service as an exception!</i></p>

<br>
    
<h3><u>For <b>SCENARIO A:</b></u></h3>
<p>Customer has a running contract with FP set-up for Infojobs, Appcast, and/or Daijob and there is a <b><u>new CP</u></b> for job listings (local and /or GFP) within the <b>SAME</b> contract.
<p>In such case, it is possible for the partner to import LOCAL credits for such customer; GFP credits have to be imported by admin</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Switch the customer into 'Self-Service'</li>
        <li>In case of <b>local credits</b>:</li>
            <ul class="none">
                <li>Switch the wallet type into 'Self-Service'</li>
                <li>Ensure that the 'posting method' on the relevant CP(s) is 'Self-Service' (if more than 10 jobs, you need to change this as admin)</li>
                <li>Ask the partner to import</li>                                    
            </ul>
        <li>In case of <b>GFP credits:</b> </li>
            <ul class="none">
                <li>Go to channels and verify what channels should be used:</li>
                    <ul class="nested">
                        <li> Delete those that the customer will not need using the delete button</li>
                        <li> Change the rest into email override in case of a fully-automated partner</li>
                        <li> Add new channels as email override if necessary</li>
                    </ul>
                <li> Change the wallet type into 'Salesforce imported and monthly PO enabled' so monthly PO can be created  </li>
                <li> Go to wallet and import the CP(s) </li>
            </ul>
        <li>In case if there is  <b>a mix of local and GFP credits</b>, follow up the procedure for GFP credits + ask the partner to create the upfront PO for local jobs</li>
    </ol>

<br>
    
<h3><u>For <b>SCENARIO B:</b></u></h3>
<p>Customer has a running contract with FP set-up for Infojobs, Appcast, and/or Daijob and there is a <b><u>partially used CP</u></b> for job listings (local and/or GFP) within the <b>SAME</b> contract</p>
<p>In such case it is <u>not</u> possible for the partner to import the credits for such customer</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Switch the customer into 'Self-Service'</li>
    <li>In case of <b>local credits:</b></li>
        <ul class='none'>
            <li>Go to channels and verify what channels should be used:</li>
                <ul class='nested'>
                    <li>Delete those that the customer will not need using the delete button</li>
                    <li>Change the rest into email override in case of a fully-automated partner</li>
                    <li>Add new channels as email override if necessary</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Go to wallet and import the CP(s)</li>
            <li>Change the wallet type from 'Salesforce imported' into 'Self-Service' so the wallet is ready for further import should there be an upsell on this contract</li>
             <li>Ask the partner to create an upfront PO for the remaining credits</li>
        </ul>
    <li>In case of <b>GFP credits:</b></li>
        <ul class='none'>
            <li>Go to channels and verify what channels should be used:</li>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>Delete those that the customer will not need using the delete button</li>
                    <li>Change the rest into email override in case of a fully-automated partner</li>
                    <li>Add new channels as email override if necessary</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Go to wallet and import the CP(s)</li>
            <li>Change the wallet type into 'Salesforce imported and monthly PO enabled' so monthly PO can be created</li>
        </ul>
    <li>In case if there is  <b>a mix of local and GFP credits</b>, follow up the procedure for GFP credits + ask the partner to create the upfront PO for local jobs</li>
</ol>
    
<br>
    
<h3><u>For <b>SCENARIO C:</b></u></h3>
<p>The customer exists in FlashPost but doesn't have any active contract in FlashPost (i.e. no active wallets) and they have signed a new contract (for local and/or GFP listings) which wasn't consumed (even partially) yet.</p>
<p>In such case, it is possible for the partner to import LOCAL credits for such customer; GFP credits have to be imported by admin.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Switch the customer into 'self-service'</li>
    <li>In case of <b>local credits:</b></li>
        <ul class='none'>
            <li>Ensure that the 'posting method' on the relevant CP(s) is 'Self-Service' (if more than 10 jobs, you need to change this as admin)</li>
            <li>Ask the partner to import</li>
        </ul>
    <li>In case of <b>GFP credits:</b></li>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Go to channels and verify what channels should be used:</li>
                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>Delete those that the customer will not need using the delete button</li>
                    <li>Change the rest into email override in case of a fully-automated partner</li>
                    <li>Add new channels as email override if necessary</li>
                </ul>  
            <li>Go to wallet and import the CP(s)</li>
            <li>The wallet type should be 'Salesforce imported and monthly PO enabled' so monthly PO can be created</li>
        </ul>
    <li>In case if there is  <b>a mix of local and GFP credits</b>, follow up the procedure for GFP credits + ask the partner to create the upfront PO for local jobs</li>
</ol>

<p>In such case, it is  <u>not</u> possible for the partner to import the credits (for the artially used CP) for such customer</p>
