<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Creating a new Self-Service customer on behalf of the partner</span></h2>
<p>This process allows you, as an admin to allow partners requesting the usage of the basic posting form for customers with <strong>more than 10 credits (any types of credits, including GFP)</strong>. If the customer purchased less than 10 credits per CP they should proceed with the import themselves by logging in as a partner.</p>

<br>

<h3>For <strong>local credits</strong>:</h3>
<p>If you allow to use Self-Service for more than 10 credits, go to Salesforce and change the 'posting method' field of the CP into 'Self-Service'; once done, the partner will be able to import this customer (or add this CP to an existing SS customer) himself </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: this is only possible for NON-USED CPs; if there is a used CP, go to the procedure about GFP credits)</p>
   
<br>
    
<h3>For <strong>GFP credits</strong>:</h3>
    <ul class="none">
        <li>If you allow to use Self-Service for GFP credits, go to Salesforce and ensure that the 'posting method' is 'FlashPost Regular'</li>
        <li>In FP, from the customers tab, click on the 'Import' button</li>
        <li>Enter the contract ID</li>
        <li>If the contract is valid and that the customer doesn't already exist, you should reach the customer creation page. Provide all required information and enable the 'self-service' toggle button (also enable the customer)</li>

        <br><br>
    
        <li>Save the customer</li>
        <li>Select channels which need to be imported and click on 'Import and delegate' channel</li>
        <img src="resources_images/FP_SS_1_2.png" width="650" height="220" style="margin-top: 0.5%;">
        <br><br>
        
        <li>Check channels (email overwrite in case of fully automated partners) and wallet (a "Salesforce imported and monthly PO enabled" wallet ) which were automatically created.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If this process was used for importing partially used CP with local jobs, the partner still needs to create a PO for the remaining credits as local jobs will not be part of the monthly PO! In case there are <strong>only LOCAL jobs</strong> in the wallet, you should change the wallet type into 'Self-Service' for further upsells</p>
