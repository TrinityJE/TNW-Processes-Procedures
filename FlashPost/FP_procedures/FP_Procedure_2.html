<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">FlashPost Errors and Rejected jobs</span></h2>
<h3>What is the procedure for errors in FlashPost?</h3>
<p>The Network is responsible for treating all errors occurring in FlashPost.</p>
<p>The errors should be checked daily, preferably twice a day (in the morning and in the afternoon).</p>
<p>The procedure to follow is:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>If you can treat the error alone, do so (temporary errors on the receiving partner side, etc.)</li>
    <li>If you cannot treat the error alone, involve the selling / receiving partner (wrong credentials, no active contract, etc.)</li>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>Once the job is successfully posted, inform the partner</li>
        </ul>
    <li>If you do not know the error, consult the rest of the team and / or Julien</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>What is the procedure for rejected jobs in FlashPost?</h3>
<p>The Network is partly responsible for treating rejected jobs occurring in FlashPost. This responsibility is shared with the job distributors and the selling partners.</p>
<p>The rejected jobs should be checked daily (once a day is enough).</p>
<p>The procedure to follow is:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>If the job was rejected because the customer is not allowed to post on a specific job board, the job distributor / partner should contact the customer and check with them; The Network will provide an assistance to partners during the adaption period (till end of August?)</li>
    <li>If the job was rejected because the listing is a duplicate (only for create action), the job distributor / partner should contact the customer and check with them; The Network will provide an assistance to partners during the adaption period (till end of August?)</li>
    <li>If the job was rejected because the user does not have permission to post on behalf of the customer specified, The Network should check this internally in the set-up and contact the partner in case more clarification is needed</li>
</ul>
