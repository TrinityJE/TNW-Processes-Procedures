<h2>Underperforming listings procedure</h2>
    
<p>To keep an eye on customers' listings and their performance, we should track <strong>underperforming listings</strong>. To do so, please follow this procedure:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Run the consumption report every Wednesday morning using the filter of the CS person in charge + filter on "Online" listing stage</li>
    <li>Add the items ‘Number of days online’ and ‘Last comment’ to the report; for now, also keep adding ‘Apply clicks’ and 'Finalized Applications' to have a comparision between our and partners' stats (however, it will be the partners' stats that will be the only source we will have)</li>
    <li>Ensure you change the 'Publication from' date for at least 3 weeks back</li>
    <li>Export the report</li>
    <li>Put a filter to only display listings that are online for 10 – 17 days</li>
    <li>Filter on Apply Clicks less than 8 clicks (so from 0 to 7 clicks). Include n/a as well - if stats are not provided by the receiving partner yet, these jobs should be included in your email.</li>
    <li>Contact the receiving partner, including the selling partner (their CS, not the AMs) in CC, using the following template (you can put it into your signature):</li>

        <i>Subject: Verification of Underperforming Job Listing(s)
        <br>        
        <br>
        Dear Partner,
        <br>
        We are reaching out regarding the following underperforming job listing(s) on your job board. Could you please review the details below and confirm that everything is correct?
        <br> 
        Please check that:
        <ul class="nested2">
        <li>The apply URL is valid and leads to the correct job listing</li>
        <li>The job title is accurate</li>
        <li>The categorization is appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <br> 
        Jobs without stats might be included in the list above as well. In that case, please provide the stats and in case the apply clicks are less than 8, do the same verification as for the other listings.  
        <br>  
        <br>
        If you have any additional suggestions or recommendations to improve the job’s performance, please feel free to share them with us.     
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for your support and cooperation.</i>
        
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <li>Put a comment on each job that you have requested review for saying you are checking for underperformance with them (visibility for admin only)</li>
    <li>Based on the feedback from the receiving partner, ensure the seller is informed as well (did they include them in their reply?), so they can undertake the necessary changes (or inform the customer about those)</li>
    <li>You can also store this in the job listing comment, visible to everyone (especially any suggestions or recommendations on improving the job)</li>
 </ul>
