<h2>Underperforming listings procedure</h2>
    
<p>As a new CS initiative, we should track <strong>underperforming listings</strong>. To do so, please follow this procedure:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Run the consumption report on Monday and Thursday morning using the filter of the CS person in charge + filter on "Online" listing stage</li>
    <li>Ensure you have added â€˜Apply clicksâ€™, 'Finalized Applications' â€˜Number of days onlineâ€™, and â€˜Last commentâ€™ to the items to report on</li>
    <li>At the same time, remove all the items for stats provided by the partner to avoid confusion (if you decide to keep those - views, aplly clicks and finalized applications provided by partner, keep them for comparision only!)</li>
    <li>Ensure you change the 'Publication from' date for at least 2 weeks back in order to be able to follow with the next steps</li>
    <li>Export the report and put a filter to only display listings that are online for 10 â€“ 13 days on Monday and 10 â€“ 12 days on Thursday (if you were off, make a wider filter from 10 to x)</li>
    <li>Filter on Apply Clicks less than 10 clicks; include also those that are 'not supported' - if there are any, you should hopefully have some data in the 'Finalized Applications' column (or in the colums with stats provided by partners if you included those)</li>
    <li>Contact the receiving partner, asking to verify the listing:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>First, they should check that the correct apply URL link (the one that FP creates) is used and that we are tracking it</li>
        <li>At the same time, verify with them the stats they have in their back office</li>
        <li>If the correct apply URL link is in place, and the stats on their side are also low, ask them how to improve the listing / any advice they can give to the customer / any action they can they on behalf of the customer to improve the results </li>
        <li>In both cases, comment on the listing by either saying all is good after all (their stats are good/correct apply URL was put in place) or by indicating that the receiving partner is taking care of the listing (once there is a comment, if you run the report next time, you will immediately spot that this job is being treated already ðŸ˜‰) </li>
    </ul>
    <li>If a listing is indeed underperforming, and you get some usable feedback (or recommendations) from the receiving partner on the listing, you should:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>In the case of FP RA, contact the user who posted the job and provide him/her with feedback and recommendations. Use the FP Support mailbox to send the email (AM and CS Team should be put in cc). Remember! You have to change the sender of the email beforing sending it.</li>
        <li>In the case of AFP, send the feedback and the recommendations to the AM and CS Team of the selling partner </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
