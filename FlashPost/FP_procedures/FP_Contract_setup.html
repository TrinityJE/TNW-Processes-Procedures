<h2>Contract set-up and delegation - New, Renew, Extend</h2>
    
<br>
    
<h3>How to set up new channels for customers in FP?</h3>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Import the customer from Salesforce to FlashPost:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Confirm the products and channels that should be created</li>
            <li>Add a logo and ENABLE the customer</li>
            <li>Assign it to CS person in charge of the customer</li>
            <li>Select the customer type - Self-Service or Regular and the posting method - Automated FP or Recruiter Application</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Automated FP, select the provider. By selecting the provider, the customer will be immediately added to the provider user</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Save the changes</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Verify the newly created wallet</li>
    <li>Chase non-responsive partners (based on the summary email you receive twice a day)</li>
    <li>If customized contract, send the template information in a separate email to all concerned partners (not all partners support customized) and for StepStone countries, created it in FP</li>
    <li>If additional info is needed or requested, send it in a separate email to the concerned partner</li>
</ul>

<br>
 
<h3> How to set up renewals/extensions in FP?</h3>
<ol class='noneol'>
    <li>(Early) Renewal - 2 contracts running at the same time with the <strong><u>same</u></strong> product type(s) available per country</li>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Delegation emails to be sent for the same channels without disabling them</li>
        </ul>
    
<br>
    
    <li>(Early) Renewal - 2 contracts running at the same time with the <strong><u>different</u></strong> product type(s) available per country</li>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Add new channel types manually (with the help of “Job boards” list in the newly created wallet) and leave existing ones enabled</li>
            <li>Delegate the renewal only to newly created channels</li>
            <li>If channel with new product type is not added, below can happen and it can cause issues on fully-automated partners such as AT, BE, DE and NL:</li>
            <image src="Resources_FP/FP_1_1.png" width="300" height="200" style="margin-top: 0.5%;"></image>
            
<br>
<br>
            
            <li>When both channel types are available for one country, the client will be able to indicate listing type when creating a listing</li>
            <image src="Resources_FP/FP_1_2.png" width="300" height="280" style="margin-top: 0.5%;"></image>

<br>
<br>
            
            <li>Once the old contract expires, old channels should be deactivated as well (hard to follow-up on though)</li>
            <li>Reason for this is that the client will still be able to select between the two types, even if they have only one type of credits available for that country</li>
            <li>Certain partners (a.k.a STST) will report an error if product type is incorrect and it doesn’t match with what they setup in the back-office. This can happen even if channel was confirmed, so the issue might not be very obvious at first</li>
            <li>Check the incoming xml file to make sure your assumptions are correct. If product type doesn’t match with what is available in the wallet, this could be the reason for the error</li>

            <image src="Resources_FP/FP_1_4.png" width="700" height="100" style="margin-top: 0.5%; margin-left: -20px;"></image>
            
<br>
<br>
            
            <li>Still double-check with the partner and confirm what product type they received from us</li>
            <li>Proceed with disabling the incorrect channel type and repost the listing as new (do not use the repost button!!!)</li>
            <li>Now the system will no longer give the user the option to select the product type</li>
            <li>If you try to repost the job in error (even if you disabled the old/incorrect channel) you will get PERMISSION ERROR reported by Flashpost:</li>
            <image src="Resources_FP/FP_1_5.png" width="600" height="150" style="margin-top: 0.5%; margin-left: -15px;"></image>
        
<br>
<br>
            
            <li>If the job board still reports an error after you made the necessary corrections, issue should really be coming from setup they did in their back-office</li>
        </ul>
   
<br>
    
    <li>Renewal - after previous contract expired, <strong>same</strong> product type per country</li>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Delegate the renewal and at the same time disable all relevant channels</li>
            <image src="Resources_FP/FP_1_6.png" width="450" height="200" style="margin-top: 0.5%;"></image>
            <br><br>
            
        </ul>
    
<br>
    
    <li>Renewal - after previous contract expired, <strong>different</strong> product type per country</li>
        <ul class="none">
            <li>Make sure to disable channels with wrong product type and at the same time manually add new ones (again help yourself with “Job boards” list in the in the newly created wallet)</li>
            <li>Delegate renewal only for newly created channels</li>
        </ul>
