<h2>Reposting Errors in FP</h2>
    
<p>You can encounter different types of errors in FP. For majority of them, you will not be able to access the 'Repost' button, and the solution to solving the error would be to ask partners/customers to post the job anew (ensuring that what caused the error is no longer present in the job listing, for example an URL in the job description).</p>
<p>Some errors happen before the job reaches the receiving partner, and it is especially here where the 'Repost' button could be used after solving the causes of the error (for example, wrong codes provided by StSt DE). In such case, you should follow <strong>these instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If the job was posted via FP Recruiter Application, you <strong>CAN</strong> use the 'Repost' button. In this case, the FP user will see that the job, previously in an error status, is now online.</li>
    <li>If the job was posted via Automated FP, however, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> use the 'Repost' button to resolve the issue as such, because in such a case, the job distributor, neither the customer, will be informed that the job is now successfuly posted and that they should NOT resend the listing again. Instead, you should:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Solve the issue with the receiving partner</li>
        <li>Test if the solution works - you should 'Repost' and if it goes through, you should immediately send a delete action and refund the credit (with a comment for others to understand)</li>
        <li>If the test worked, contact the selling partner and explain the situation. It should be them who decides if they will post the job anew on behalf of the customer and inform him or if they ask the customer to do so. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
