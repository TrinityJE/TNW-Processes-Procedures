<h2>Expense Note Procedure</h2>
<p>When you need to expense something to the company (costs during company events, well-being allowance, etc.), you should follow this procedure:<p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Use <a href="https://stepstonecore.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/TheNetwork/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC36F00D6-5369-4D33-A8EF-0202D6C46665%7D&file=Expense%20Note_blank.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">this expense note Excel template</a> (if you don’t have it saved yet)</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>In case of a first use, make sure to fill in Name, IBAN, and BIC; then save for next use</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fill in the current month in which you are expensing some costs (top right)</li>
    <li>Start filling in the individual expenses you have:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li><strong>Doc. number:</strong> Always start with number 1 and continue until the number of expenses you have</li>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> Input the date when the expense occurred</li>
        <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Indicate what the expense is related to (in most cases, it will be something like ‘TNW Workshop – Airport’ or ‘Well-being allowance’)</li>
        <li><strong>Comment:</strong> Input any details related to the expense, i.e., parking, breakfast, new running shoes, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal car use:</strong> Should you use your car for a company event, you can expense the cost as well; simply input the number of km and the related cost</li>
        <li><strong>Foreign currency:</strong> In case your expense was done in a foreign currency, input the cost in the foreign currency (i.e., 25 USD) and check on <a href="https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/?from=USD&to=EUR&amount=1" target="_blank">OANDA</a> what the exchange rate was on the given day</li>
        <li><strong>Amount EUR (column I):</strong></li>
        <ul class="nested2"> 
            <li>If your expense was in EUR, simply input the amount in here</li>
            <li>f your expense was in a foreign currency, input the EUR amount you got from OANDA </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Amount (column L):</strong> Do not touch as this column is automated and it calculates the total amount that should be paid for the expense note (if you scroll down, you will see the total amount there)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>There is no need to sign the expense note anymore</li>
    <li>As for the documents proving the costs claimed in the expense note, you should:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>Save each expense in a PDF document separately</li>
        <li>You should name each document the same as you call it in column C, including the Doc. number (i.e., if the first entry in the expense note is 1. / 21.5.2025 / Management Forum – Airport, then the name of the document that you submit for this expense should be ‘1. Management Forum – Airport’</li>
        <li>If you lose the receipt itself, you can use a screenshot of the actual payment from your online banking</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once the expense note and the supporting documents are ready, create a folder 'Exepnse Note - Your name', zip the file and send them to <a href="mailto:orn@the-network.com">ORN</a> email </li>
</ul>
