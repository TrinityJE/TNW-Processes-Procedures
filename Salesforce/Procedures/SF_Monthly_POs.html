<h2>Monthly reports and POs</h2>
    
<h3>General</h3>   
<ul class="none">
    <li>Regularly update the <strong>'Monthly reports’</strong> sheet in <a href="https://stepstonecore.sharepoint.com/sites/TheNetworkServiceDeliveryTeam/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank">Share Point</a> – add, update, and delete customers if needed</li>
    <li>Make sure that last month data are preserved by creating a tab for a new month if you are the first one to see the report at the beginning of the month </li>
    <li>Ensure that all automated reports were sent (you should be in cc for all of them)</li>
    <li>If you still have some manual reports, created them on time so the monthly PO is validated the latest on <strong><u>15th of each month</u></strong></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Monthly POs</h3>
<ul class="none">
    <li> During the last week of each month, test wallets in FP admin console to see if everything is correct and if your monthly PO will be created – in case of errors, do the necessary (create missing WWs, add missing CC, solve credit issues, etc.)</li>
    <li>On 1<sup>st</sup> working day of each month, check Slack for <strong>errors</strong> on monthly POs for your customers</li>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>If there is an error, check where the problem is and try to solve it (i.e., issue a WW, add a CC, etc.) and try to export the wallet again in FP admin console to issue a new PO</li>
            <li>At the same time, ensure that the system did not create a PARTIAL PO for the faulty wallet! If yes, simply delete it</li>
            <li>Don’t forget that some POs, though created automatically, might need additional POLIs to be added in case of manual posting imported into FP</li>
        </ul>
    <li>When validating monthly PO you are responsible for ensuring that <u>the wallet consumption correspond to the contract consumption!</u> Possible reasons for <strong>discrepancies</strong> can be:</li>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>Credit provisioned for semi-automated partners (if the job listing for such a partner was created on the last day of the month and the partner only published it in the new month; what counts is the start date, not the created date!)</li>
                <ul class="nested2">
                    <li>What counts is the start date, not the created date – even some automated partners (SE, France, etc.) might confirm the job listing manually with start date in a new month</li>
                    <li>Careful to partners confirming a job listing in new month with start date in the previous month!!! Such a job can get lost (is not part of this month PO and will not be part of the next month PO</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Check for AT/BE/DE/NL jobs expired within 24h – these are automatically refunded by DE but not in FP – you need to refund it and adjust the POLI for DE by deducing the credit</li>
            <li>Refund on a job from last month (after the monthly PO was created) – in such case, you should adjust the monthly PO in SF before validating it / delete the PO if already validated but still in the SAME month</li>
            <li>Import with a start date before the monthly PO was created</li>
                <ul class="nested2">
                    <li>If the PO is not validated yet, you can add a new POLI </li>
                    <li>If the PO is already validated, you should create a new PO for the import only</li>   
                </ul>
            <li>Wrongly set-up initial number of credits (should not happen anymore as all credits are imported automatically but might happen if you play incorrectly with deducing and adding credits by switching wallet types)</li>
            <li>Upsell done after monthly PO was created – this will resolve itself with the next monthly PO</li>
            <li>Manually created POs in SF (for additional need, an exception, etc.) – if possible, these credits should be imported into FP to match the credit consumption</li>
            <li>Manually created monthly PO (you have two monthly POs in the system) – simply delete the manually created one and keep the automatic one</li>
            <li>Exchange of credits for other product – exchanging products usually deduce posting credits so you should ensure that you do the necessary changes in deducing FP credits to match SF</li>
            <li>Other – if you cannot identify the problem, check with Kate on how to proceed</li>
        </ul>
    <li>It is <strong>NO LONGER</strong> needed to infrom receiving partners about their OUT POs - they can see them in SF and they are used to it now</li>
    <li>Update the monthly report file with the status of the customer (waiting for submission, done) and the day the PO was validated</li>
</ul>
