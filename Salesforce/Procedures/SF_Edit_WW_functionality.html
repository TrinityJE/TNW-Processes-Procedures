<h2>Edit WW functionality</h2>    
<p>This new functionality gives the selling parther the option to edit <strong>VALID WWs</strong> (non-expired and not linked to a contract).</p>
<p>To use it, the selling partner has to follow <strong>the below steps:</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>They should select all the WWs they want to edit and click on a new button 'Edit WW' that is displayed on the WW related list of the customer account</li>
    <li>As mentioned above, only valid WWs will be submitted for editing - if a selected WW is not eligible for the edit action, they will receive an error (if this is the only WW he selected for the edit action), or a warning (in case there are several WWs selected and some of them are not eligible)</li>
    <li>The selling partner can edit ALL fields in the 'Additional Information' section and they are obliged to summarize the changes in a new 'Edit Comment' field. All fields except 'Subsidiaries included' are mandatory ones</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Edited WWs will have a new status 'To Edit' and will be resent to the receiving partners (they will see them in the WWs To Do and Edit table on their homepage). The <strong>due date</strong> of the WW will reset and they will have again 2 working days to answer them.</p>
<p>If the edited WW is not answered on time, they will be <strong>auto answered</strong> with their previous reply (so, if a WW was on 'Waiting for Approval' status, after the auto answer, it will be again in 'Waiting for Approval' status). Exception is the status 'To Edit' when a activity was marked, but the WW was NOT submitted for approval. In such a case, the receiving partner would have to either un tag the activity field if there was no WW product created and answer the WW with 'Done' or, if there was a WW product created, submit the WW for approval.</p>
