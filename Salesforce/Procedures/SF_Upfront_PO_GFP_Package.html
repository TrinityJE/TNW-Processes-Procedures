<h2>Procedure for creating an upfront PO from a GFP package</h2>    
<p>In exceptional cases, it is possible to create an upfront PO from a GFP package to block certain credits/amount for the receiving partner.</p>
<p>Always warn the selling partner that giving an upfront PO from a GFP package can have as a consequence loss of credits (in case the customer does not post the number of jobs that were given via the upfront PO, they will lose those).</p>
<p>To create an upfront PO from a GFP package, please follow <strong>this procedure:</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>In <strong>SF</strong>, follow these two steps:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>Create <strong>an upfront PO</strong> for the number of credits requested from the GFP package in question to the specific receiving partner; if this PO is issued to cover protection, ensure that you put the following comment in the <strong>justification field</strong> of the IN PO: “Upfront PO to cover protection”</li>
        <li>Create an administrative CP for local listings (the same amount of credits for which the upfront PO was created) for the receiving partner in question but with 0€ unit price (do NOT issue PO for it); only needed if the jobs will be posted via FP</li>
    </ul>
    <li>In <strong>FP</strong>, follow these two steps: </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Deduce the number of credits equal to the upfront PO from the GFP package in question (put a comment)</li>
        <li>Import the local credits to FP (only in case the jobs should be posted via FP; not needed in case of direct access)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
