<h2>LuxPlus Procedure</h2>    
<p>Whenever Jobs.lu sells a LuxPlus product, this product should split in between Jobs.lu, StepStone.DE, and Figaro. As we need to recognize the whole value of the product (not only the part for Figaro), there is <strong>a new procedure</strong> to follow:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Jobs.lu creates a quote with catalog products (standard, customized, etc.) for both the French and StepStone parts (the StepStone part will be introduced under Jobs.lu)</li>
    <li>Jobs.lu needs to pay attention to the posting method of each product - in case of France, it can be both Self-Service or direct, but for Jobs.lu it has to be DIRECT</li>
    <li>Jobs.lu uses the 'new price' functionality to enforce the agreed price (based on negotiation with Figaro). And example of 1 LuxPlus job lisitng that would cost 1300€ would be as follows => the French product should have a 'new price' of 495€, and the product for Jobs.lu should have a 'new price' of 805€. The pricing for the French part can be seen here (valid ONLY for Cadremploi!; if the product is for Figaro Emploi + Cadremploi, a price is upon request)</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>1 LuxPlus listing - unit price €495</li>
        <li>10 LuxPlus listings - unit price €445.5</li>
        <li>100 Lux Plus listings - unit price €297</li>
        <li>Above 100 listings - unit price upon request</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Jobs.lu should mention that this is a 'LuxPlus' product both in <strong>the header</strong> of the quote, as well as in <strong>the comment</strong> of the product itself</li>
    <li>France has to approve the quote (as the 'new price' was used)</li>
    <li>Jobs.lu wons the quote</li>
    <li>Jobs.lu imports the French prodcut into FlashPost (if applicable) - a PO is created by FlashPost automatically</li>
    <li>Jobs.lu creates an ad-hoc PO for the StepStone part and submits it for approval (eventually for the French product as well, if the posting method is 'direct'</li>
    <li>The Network adds a contract-product attribute to each LuxPlus CP to enable smooth reporting)</li>
</ul>
