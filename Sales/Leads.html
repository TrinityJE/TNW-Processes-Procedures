<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Leads &amp; Decision Maker</span></h2>
<h3>Leads</h3>
<p>In case a partner comes across a company and identifies that the Decision Maker is not based in their country, the partner is requested to send a lead to the partner covering the country where the Decision Maker is based (this is the partner entitled to sell to the customer or selling partner).</p>

<br>

<h3>Decision Maker</h3>
<p>The Decision Maker is the person or team who has the power of signature.</p>
<p>hese are roles like Head of Talent Acquisition, Talent Acquisition Manager, HR Director, Sourcing Director, or any relevant title that includes “Global”, “International” or “EMEA”, etc. in it.</p>
<p>In some cases, the power of signature might be delegated to a third party (see section Types of Companies in this document) who will handle the negotiations and/or the recruitment for the customer.</p>
<p>During the 1st contact with the customer, the partner is requested to check where its Decision Maker is located. According to the Territory Rule, if the location is out of the partner’s borders, it is recommended to gather detailed information on the company &amp; their request, and hand it over to the appointed partner that covers the country where the prospect is located (rightful selling partner).</p>
<p>If there is any doubt on the Decision Maker’s location, please contact The Network. If later during the process, the Decision Maker’s location is identified as out of the partner’s borders, then the deal will go to the appropriate selling partner. It is therefore in all partners’ interest to check this point carefully &amp; honestly before progressing with the sale.</p>
