<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Conversion</span></h2>
<p>Conversion is something we have been offering in these exceptional times as a way to compensate customers who were heavily impacted by Covid-19. These had the benefit of using-up the remaining inventory quickly so that customers didn’t end their contracts with a lot of unused credits. But now that we are reaching some stability, we would like to draw a clear set of rules for conversions of GFP products.</p>
<p>Conversions are given when a customer needs exceptional flexibility, they should not be taken for granted. All conversions of GFP products must be validated by The Network Sales team.</p>
<p>Conversions should only be requested under exceptional circumstances where there will be a striking underconsumption at the end of the contract. These will be studied on a case by case basis.</p>
<ul>
    <li>GFP credits may only be converted into local credits.</li>
    <li>Conversions may only be requested during the last 3 months before the contract expires.</li>
    <li>Conversions <u>may only be done into our partner’s products.</u> It is not acceptable to have GFP credits converted into products of niche job boards that are not offered via The Network.</li>
</ul>
