<h2>Extension &amp; Carry Over</h2>
<p>The Network allows either Extension or Carry Over, depending on the case. However, the rule says we should not allow both, unless agreed with sales.</p>

<br>

<h3>Extension of a contract</h3>
<p>Contract extension is allowed only in exceptional cases. It is understood that for some contracts, extra renewal negotiation time might be needed, therefore the application of 2 extra months as extension. The selling partner is requested to get approval from The Network before granting these to the customer.</p>
<p>CS Team is in charge of this procedure now:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>For GFP – CS team to approve; for local it’s the receiving partner who needs to give approval.</li>
    <li>Exceptional cases: extension + carry over can be granted (when extra tool is needed for negotiation).</li>
    <li>Renewal is NOT a must anymore in order to extend the contract.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Carry over</h3>
<p>In case a contract is about to end and the customer has unused inventory, they can carry over these credits into a new contract.</p>
<p>In case of a <strong>local contract</strong>, there is no limitation on % of credits to carry over; this is established by the receiving partner and what they allow the customer to do.</p>
<p>To process a carry-over from a local contract, you should follow <strong>this procedure:</strong></p>    
<ul class='none'>
    <li>In the new contract, if the product is the SAME as for the credits to be carried over (i.e. local standard jobs for Hungary both in the original and the new contract), there is no need to create a separate CP for these carried-over credits</li>
    <ul class='nested'>
        <li>You should simply add them to the CP of the new product under the ‘Carry Over (for local credits)’ field in the FlashPost &amp; CPQ information</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="Images/carry_over.png" alt="carry-over">

<br> 
    
    <li>If the product is NOT the same, though, you will have to create a separate CP for these carried-over credits</li>
    <ul>
        <li>You will need to fill the ‘Original contract-product reference’ with the CP reference number from the contract the credits are being carried over</li>
        <li>The unit price should be 0€ (as they were already paid off in the original contract with an upfront PO)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<br>
    
<p>In case of a <strong>GFP contract</strong>, they are allowed to carry over 20% of the remaining net credits under the condition that the customer renews with a contract value equal to or greater than the one about to expire. 
<p>To process a carry-over from a GFP contract, you should follow <strong>this procedure:</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>In the new contract, create a separate CP(s) for the carried-over credit(s) and use the CP attribute ‘Carry Over’</li>
    <li>You will need to fill the ‘Original contract-product reference’ with the CP reference number from the contract the credits are being carried over</li>
    <li>The unit price of the carried-over credits should be the unit price of the original CP from which the credits are being carried over </li>
</ul>
<p>In case a customer has already carried over GFP credits in the previous contract, the 20% will be calculated from the net remaining credits. This means that the credits that were already carried over will be subtracted from the number of credits remaining, before calculating the 20% that can be carried over.<strong>It can be difficult to follow up, but, yes, its possible.</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>1<sup>st</sup> year</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>    
    <li>Contract volume: 100 listings</li>
    <li>Remaining volume at contract end: 50 listings</li>
    <li>Total listings to carry over 20% of 50 = 10 listings to carry over to next contract</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> year</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>New purchased volume: 100 listings</li>
    <li>Total volume: 100 + 10 = 110 listings</li>
    <li>Remaining volume at contract end: 40 listings</li>
    <li>Net remaining volume: 40 listings - 10 listings (already carried over in year 1) = 30 listings</li>
    <li>Total listings to carry over 20% of 30 listings = 6 listings to carry over next contract</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> year</strong></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>New purchased volume: 200 listings</li>
    <li>Total volume: 200 + 6 = 206 listings</li>
    <li>Remaining volume at contract end: 105 listings</li>
    <li>Net remaining volume: 105 listings - 6 listings (already carried over in year 2) = 99 listings</li>
    <li>Total listings to carry over 20% of 99 listings = 20listings</li>
</ul>
