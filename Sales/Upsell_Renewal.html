<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Upsell &amp; Renewal</span></h2>
<p>If your customer is running out of credits and wants to buy extra job listings before the end of the contract, or if they want to purchase other products, they can upsell or renew.</p>

<br>

<h3>Upsell</h3>
<p>The Network considers <strong>2 types of upsells:</strong></p>
<h4>Same Products:</h4>
<p>Adding more units of a previously bought product to a running contract. It is possible to add more job listings to a running contract.</p>
<p>The upsell products will be added directly into the main contract. Therefore, the Value to Protect will be discounted from the sum of the main contract plus the upsell contract.</p>
<p>The Upsell conditions are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The end date on the upsell contract must be the same as on the main contract</li>
    <li>This contract will use the WWs from the main contract</li>
    <li>The rate can be the same as the one used for the previous volume purchased, or quoted based on the Pricing Tool</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If the original product bought was 100 GFP Level 1 listings at a rate of 98€ per listing, and now the customer wants to add 50 more GFP Level 1 listings to that contract, these can be added at a rate of 98€ per listing (or the selling partner can use the prices for the volume of 50 listings according to the Pricing Tool).</p>

<br>
  
<h4>Different Products:</h4>
<p>Sometimes customers want to add new different products to a running contract. These products can be added anytime within the contract duration.</p>
<p>In case the customer has a contract for listings and is interested in purchasing a CVDB access or communication products, these should be quoted using the Pricing Tool. In this instance, the product validity (time available for the customer to consume the products) can differ from the contract duration. This implies that service validity can exceed the contract duration <i>(it was mainly created in regard to protection values of existing contracts; not to double protection values within the same year. And to avoid standalone contract with CVDB services, which will complicate a future creation of another renewal contract in SF with one country in it)</i>. The type of PO to be used in this case is Upfront PO.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The customer bought 100 GFP Level 1 listings with a contract duration of 12 months. After 6 months, the customer decides to purchase a 12-month CVDB access. As the CVDB is being bought while the main contract is still running and an upfront PO will be issued for it, the selling partner can simply indicate in the PO’s comment field that the duration of this product should be 12 months.</p>
<p>In case the customer has a contract for CV DB access or Communication products and is interested in purchasing listings, these should be quoted using the Pricing Tool. In this case, if the original contract had a duration less than 6 months, The Network recommends creating a New Contract, given that it was a purchase to cover a one-time-need. If the original contract had a duration >6 months, The Network recommends creating an Upsell Contract, which will have the same end date as the original contract, in this case protection will not re-start running. Yes,it depends a lot on case by case, how much time original contract already is running, on value to protect, number f listings purchased, etc.</p>

<br>

<h3>Renewal:</h3>
<p>A main contract can be renewed during the whole duration of the contract up to 2 months after its expiry date.</p>
<p>When renewing a contract, all the conditions of the main contract are re-set, meaning that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The contract duration will re-start</li>
    <li>Additional discounts, if needed, will have to be (re-)negotiated among partners</li>
    <li>The applied rates should be according to Pricing Tool</li>
    <li>Protection re-starts counting so it will start from 0 when the contract is renewed</li>
    <li>WWs: if the main contract gets renewed, the WWs that were used in the main contract will be duplicated (cloned), see example. If the customer wants to include new countries into the renewal contract, WWs will need to be sent to these new countries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The main contract includes Austria, Belgium and Croatia. At the renewal time, the customer is interested in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Argentina and Mexico, but not Croatia.     The selling partner selects the countries that the customer wants to use again, so the WWs for Austria and Belgium will be duplicated with their original answers and Values to Protect. For Denmark, Argentina and Mexico, new WWs will have to be issued. The WW for Croatia will not be duplicated because it was not selected for the renewal.</p>
    
<br>

<h3>Some additional comments:</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, if the main contract is not renewed within its duration or 2 months after the expiry date and a new contract is signed, all WWs will have to be re-issued to all the relevant receiving countries. Protection will stay the same, for up to 2 months after the contract expiry date, for those receiving partners that did not engage in a local relationship with the customer (2 month extension + 2 month opportunity to approach locally). If a local relationship was initiated by the receiving partner 2 months after the expiry date and new value was created, the new value generated will have to be protected. </p>
<p>After extension, there is always 2 months for partners to sign a renewal.</p>
<p>If after 4 months since the contract end date (2 month extension + 2 month opportunity to approach locally), no local relationship has been initiated by the receiving partner and a new WW is received, the VTP will be €0, unless there have been email conversations between both partners about the late renewal. (exceptions apply, and protections do apply, case by case).</p>
