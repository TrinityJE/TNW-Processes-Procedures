<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Subsidiaries</span></h2>
<p>In case of international business opportunities with a holding company and its subsidiaries, the selling partner is recommended to get in touch with The Network team and with the concerned receiving partner(s) before sending any proposals.</p>
<p>In case a customer has subsidiaries and their budget is controlled by the entity that manages the international contract, the subsidiaries should be mentioned in the CRM. For this purpose, there is a specific box for subsidiaries that should be filled in when a WW is created.</p>
<p>If a receiving partner has a local deal for any of the subsidiaries (or the parent account), protection will be applied on ALL POs, no matter the subsidiary used. For example, customer Apple has subsidiaries A, B, and C. Spain, as a receiver, has a local deal with subsidiary B. Spain will then receive a protection on any job posted under Apple, Subsidiary A, B, or C, until the protection is consumed; then, normal split will apply.</p>
