<h2>Types of Companies</h2>
<p>When selling, the partner might encounter different types of companies. When sending a WW, the selling partner should ensure to always state the name of the end customer and, when relevant, all subsidiaries and/or possible different company names per country/market. WW replies should be always done based on the end customer.</p>
<p>These are the types of customers you might face:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li><strong>Corporate:</strong>End customer (i.e. Amazon)</li>
    <li><strong>Media Agencies:</strong> Agencies whose business model is based on commission. All partners agreed to grant them 15% commission.</li>
    <li><strong>Recruitment Consultancies:</strong> Consultancies that handle the entire recruitment process for the end customer and whose business model is performance based (e.g. Adecco, Randstad, Hays). It is important to note that these businesses publish the listings under their own name instead of the end customer’s. In case of international business opportunities with recruitment consultancies, the selling partner is recommended to get in touch with The Network team and directly with the concerned receiving partner(s) before sending any proposals.</li>  
    <li><strong>RPOs:</strong> Recruitment Process Outsource (RPO) companies where end customers outsource some, or all of their recruitment process to an external provider. On some occasions, it is not always possible to know that an RPO exists, as the contact works on-site, with company email address and business card. You are then only aware if the contact informs to of the relationship. Either way, the internal process must be based on the end customer and purchases made for one client at a time. Example RPO companies include; AMS, AON and Cielo.</li>
    <li><strong>Resellers:</strong> In case of international business opportunities with resellers, the selling partner is requested to get in touch with The Network team and with the concerned receiving partner(s) before sending any proposals. (France has never agreed to cover reseller prices). Reseller rate cards are maintained by SGO team.</li>
</ul>

<br>
    
<p>Our <strong>current resellers</strong> are:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Germany:</li>
        <ul class='nested'>
            <li>Konigsteiner</li>
            <li>Jobticket</li>
            <li>VONQ</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Austria:</li>
        <ul clas='nested'>
            <li>Iventa:M4J Personalanzeigen GmbH</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Sweden:</li>
        <ul class='nested'>
            <li>TeamTailor</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<br>
              
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Media Agencies, RC, Resellers + RPOs cannot have 1 multi-end customer GFP packages, but there will be local price or smaller GFP packs per client/job board -> 1 contract per end customer.</p>
