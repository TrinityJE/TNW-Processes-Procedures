<h2>Jobbsys new procedure</h2>
<p>Jobbsys is now created as a partner in Salesforce &amp; each transaction should be recorded in there.</p>
<p>The <strong>reasons</strong> for this change are: </p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Having the values in SF will allow us to calculate our revenue more effeciently</li>
    <li>We no longer need a special procedure for invoicing partners as POs will be directly included in monthly invoices</li>
    <li>We will be able to match Jobbsys invoice against actual POs</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>CS procedure:</h3>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>There is NO WAY to confirm the final EURO price before having an actual job listing</li>
    <li>Once you receive the job listing from the selling partner, send it to Norway (Anne-Lene) to get a confirmation on the final price</li>
    <li>Once you receive a confirmation from Jobbsys on the final price, you <strong>MUST</strong> confirm it back within 48h!!!</li>
    <li>You will need to calculate the total net amount using <a href="https://stepstonecore.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/TheNetwork/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFC940F79-F70B-4B40-98BA-50FA6F98C3E5%7D&file=Norway_calculation%20form.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true" target="_blank">this calculator</a>, and then share this final price with the selling partner</li>
    <li>At the same time, ask the selling partner to create a new customer in Salesforce if not created yet and to add Norway as Account-Country (no WW will be launched as it is NOT needed for the contract/PO creation)</li>
    <li>Once the account exists, create a 12-month contract and a Contract-Product with the purchased services to Norway: standard <strong>without</strong> Finn, customized <strong>with</strong> Finn </li>
    <li>Insert the the total net amount which you calculated using the calculator</li>    
    <li>Create a PO and POLI:</li>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>In case of Jobbsys/Purehelp, simply check if the "You can invoice us" amount corresponds to the amount Jobbsys asked for</li>
            <li>In case of Jobbsys/Purehelp + Finn, change the "You can invoice us" amount with the amount Jobbsys asked for &amp; the splits will adjust automatically</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Finance procedure:</h3>
<p>With Jobbsys in Salesforce, finance procedure becomes the same as for other partners:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Make sure the invoice includes EUR amount and that it matches with what's in "You can invoice us"</li>
    <li>Process the invoice in Salesforce and add it to the file for our accountant</li>
    <li>IN POs will be included in monthly invoices sent to partners</li>
</ul>
