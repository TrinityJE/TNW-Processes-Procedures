<h2>Totaljobs contract signing</h2>
<p>Totaljobs account managers create contracts to invoice upfront OUT POs they receive for accounts in their targets (usually when protection is involved)</p>
<p>They are instructed to send these contracts to Finance The Network mailbox and even to Lucija's personal mailbox (lately, they are sending it to individual CS people)</p>
<p>Whenever you are asked to sign such a document, please follow below steps: </p>
<ol class="noneol">
    <li>Look for email from the AM with subject <strong>Your Totaljobs.com Contract Agreement is ready to sign!</strong></li>
    <li>Click on <strong>View Document</strong></li>
    <li>Check the products included and make sure the out_PO reference is correct - look it up in Salesforce!</li>
    <li>Their invoice is always in GBP (they make the conversion themselves) so it is very important that the EUR amount they can invoice is always mentioned in the Terms and Conditions field - this amount needs to match with what is in the "You can invoice us" field in Salesforce:</li>

    <br><br>
    <li>If the amount is not there or incorrect, you need to ask them to correct it and send a new contract for signing</li>
    <li>Once OK, sign the contract by clicking into Signature field. It should prefill with your name.</li>
    <li>Then Complete signing and you will receive the confirmation email with contract in PDF</li>
    <li>Forward this contract to Finance</li>
</ol>
