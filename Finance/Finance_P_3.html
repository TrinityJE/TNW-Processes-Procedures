<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Yearly Invoices</span></h2>
<p>The Network is issuing a yearly invoice to all its partners. This invoice is based on report of active and received sales for the given year that should be pre-run in December but the final update should happen at the beginning of January to have the full view of the previous year.</p>
<p>The most important points connected to yearly invoices are:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>Issued in the first 2 months of the year (Jan - Feb)</li>
    <li>They comprise of Salesforce license fee + Marketing Budget (partnership fee)</li>
    <li>If partner's active and received sales are less than 30k, they are recharged half of SF yearly fee</li>
    <li>In our T&amp;Cs:
        <p><I>Partner shall pay 816 USD per User License per year for the use of the CRM. Each Partner purchases at least one User License. That price - based on the 2017 pricing - can evolve in time because of salesforce pricing changes or exchange rate evolution between Euros and USD. The yearly fee shall be invoiced upfront at the beginning of each year and shall be payable within 30 days.</I></p></li>
    <li>Partnership fee is 750 EUR in the 1st year and 1500 EUR 2nd year and after, as per details in our T&amp;Cs:
        <p><i>Year one of Partnership: 750 €, if a Partners joins the Network before July of a year, the Network will invoice 750 € during that year. If a Partner joins the Network in or after July, the Network will invoice these 750 € in January of the following year.</i></p></li>
