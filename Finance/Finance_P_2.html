    <h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Under consumption passthrough</span></h2>
    <p>This process is to be done <strong>every 6 months</strong>. The finance part, which was done last in August 2022, it was for the contracts which ended until the end of December 2021. (Always contract end dates). A new report and POs to be created in September 2022 for the <strong>contracts end dates</strong> from 01/01/2022 to 30/06/2022, etc.</p>
    <p>The process should <strong>always</strong> consider the renewal 2 months period when partners have up to 2 months to renew an expired contract (a period we need to consider in case there are carryovers, extensions, etc. That is why we do not do it in June/January <strong>but rather in September/April.</strong></p>
    <p>To perfrom a successful under consumption procedure, you should follow <span style="color: #8B6DEA;">these steps</span>:</p>
    
    <br>

    <h3><strong><u>Sales Process</u></strong></h3>
    <ul class="none">
        <li>Go to the <a href="https://stepstonecore.sharepoint.com/sites/TheNetwork/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FTheNetwork%2FShared%20Documents%2FNETWORK%20TEAM%2FSALES%2FBI%20Strategy%2F10%25%20underconsumption%2F20210401%20until%2020211231%2FFinal&viewid=185cfc1b%2Dff3b%2D4a9f%2Db6d5%2D3228a9ed6439" target="_blank">pool</a> where all files for underconsumption are stored</li>
        <li>Create a new folder for the period you are going to work on (i.e., 20220101 until 20200630)</li>        <li>To know which contracts are concerned for the given period, you need to run a SF report <a href="https://thenetwork.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O07000000JnKkEAK/view?queryScope=userFolders" target="_blank">‘Underconsumption 10% NW’</a></li>
        <li>Change the <strong>date filters</strong>: contracts which expired from 01/01/20xx till 30/06/20xx / from 01/07/20xx till 31/12/20xx (as we are doing it every 6 months). <strong>Remember!</strong> The exercise should be only done min. 2 months after the filter end date (September / April).</li>
        <li>Export the report into xls, details only</li>
        <li>Tidy up the report:</li>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>Save the report into the folder you just created and call it '10% underconsumption all 20xxxxxx to 20xxxxxx'</li>
                <li>Create an actual table from the data</li>
                <li>Rename the columns to be tidier</li>
                <li>Change the Net Price column in actual currency (€)</li>
                <li>Move the column Partner in charge from the last place to the first place (column A)</li>
                <li>Rename the sheet into "Data"</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add several new columns:</li>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>Column M 'Net unit price'; you need to add a formula: Net price eur (L) / No of jobs (K) --> =[@[Net price EUR]]/[@[Nb Jobs/Product]]</li>
                <li>Column O 'Under-consumed'; you need to add a formula: No of jobs (K) - Consumed (N) --> =[@[Nb Jobs/Product]]-[@Consumed]</li>
                <li>Column P 'Adjustment'; we should only enter a negative number here</li>
                <li>Column Q 'Adjustment reason'; we should state a reason why we entered a negative number into Column 0</li>
                <li>Column R 'Under-consumed Final'; you need to add a formula: Under-consumed (O) + Adjustment (P) --> =[@[Under-Consumed]]+[@Adjustment] (the result should be negative)</li>
                <li>Column S 'Passthrough %'; per default, we add 10% for everyone. However, we need to adjust the split if case of intra-StepStone consumption on <strong>LOCAL JOBS</strong> only (GFP is automatically 10%). By using filters on Partner in charge, we check StepStone Group countries (Careerjunction, Carribean jobs, Irishjobs, Jobs.ie, Jobs.lu, Nijobs, StSt AT, StSt BE, StSt DE, StSt NL, Tecoloco, TJ) and:</li>
                    <ul class='nested2'>
                        <li>If they posted to a StepStone country, we change the split to 0%</li>
                        <li>If they posted to a non-StepStone country, we keep the split 10%</li>
                        <li>If they posted to The Network (translation), it is up to our judgement if we want to invoice them for this or not</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Column S 'The Network invoices'; you need to add a formula: (Under-consumed final (R)) * (Net Unit Price (M)) * (Passthrough % (S)) --> =[@[Under-consumed Final]]*([@[Net Unit Price]]*[@[Passthrough %]])</li>
            </ul>
        <img src="resources_finance/Finance_P_2_1.png" width="1000" height="300" style="margin-left: 2.5%; margin-top: 0.5%;"> 
        
    <br><br>
    
        <li>Add two new sheets with pivot tables to show the final data clearly:</li>
            <ul class="nested2">
                <li>Overview partners - select Partner in charge in rows, and 'Sum of The Network invoices' in values</li>
                <li>Overview customers - select 'Partner in charge' and 'Customer' in the rows, and 'Sum of Under-consumed Final' and 'Sum of The Network invoices' in values</li>
            </ul>
        
    <br>
    
        <li>Back in Salesforce, run another report <a href="https://thenetwork.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O07000000JnKuEAK/view?queryScope=userFolders" target="_blank">‘Negative POs by contract end date’</a> and change the filters of contract end date to the same dates: from 01/01/20xx till 30/06/20xx / from 01/07/20xx till 31/12/20xx</li>
        <li>Export the report into xls, details only</li>
        <li>Open this new report in a different window for better visualization</li>
        <li>Using the report of negative POs, we match CPs with the 10% underconsumption report we just saved (we can use Vlookup function or do it manually)</li>
        <li>When we find a match (there <strong>IS</strong> a negative PO for a CP that is on our 10% underconsumption report), we add this information into the column P (Adjustment) using a negative number and at the same time we add a reason to column Q (Adjustment reason), stating there was a negative PO (and we can add the negative PO reference). Any other records can be ignored as they are not in our 10% underconsumption report.</li>
        
    <br>
    
        <li>Once more we go back to Salesforce and we run the last report <a href="https://thenetwork.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O07000000JnKzEAK/view?queryScope=userFolders" target="_blank">'Carry and roll overs for 10% underconsum'</a> and change the filters of contract creation date; for example starts from 01/11/20xx for the period 01/01/20xx till 30/06/20xx or 01/05/20xx for the period 01/07/20xx till 31/12/20xx (we look at CP creations dates as of the first day when the under consumed contracts could have expired and we go 2 months behind just in case there were some corrections)</li>
        <li>We manually check each entry (we can skip a lot of entries as they have 'roll' in the comment used as a job title) but we mainly focus on GFPs</li>
        <li>If we find something relevant, we again update column P (Adjustment) and column Q (Adjustment reason) as we did when checking the negative POs report</li>
      
    <br>
    
        <li>Return back to the 10% underconsumption report and focus on the three comments fields ('Contract comment', 'Admin contract comments', and 'CP comments') to eliminate another potential CPs that should not be charged</li>
        <li>If we find something relevant, we again update column P (Adjustment) and column Q (Adjustment reason) as we did when checking the negative POs and Carry and roll overs reports</li>
        <li>After we do the necessary changes, we delete these threee colums ('Contract comment', 'Admin contract comments', and 'CP comments') as they will not be relevant for the partners</li>
      
    <br>
    
        <li>We save a copy of the final report, and from the copy, we start generation reports for each partner</li>
        <li>The moment we start working on a new report, we save it immediately - the name stays the same (remove COPY reference) but we include the partners name before the date (i.e. 10% underconsumption Appcast 20220101 to 20220630)</li>
        <li>In each report, we keep the 'Customer overview' and 'Data' sheets and we delete the 'Overview partners' sheet</li>
        <li>In the 'Data' sheet, we order the data by 'Partner in charge' and simply delete all unnecessary entries (i.e., if we are doing a report for Appcast, we keep Appcast records but delete everything else)
        <li>Once we deleted all unnecessary data, we update the 'Customer overview' sheet which will show us the total that we should charge amount the partner for</li>
      
    <br>
    
        <li>We then communicate the amount and the CPs to partners to have their feedback on potential corrections (negative POs, carry overs, etc.). All the communications are in the Sales mailbox - an old email should be reused, and we should simply change the dates and the amount to invoice and leave the rest of the info as it is</li>
        <img src="resources_finance/Finance_P_2_3.jpg" width="1100" height="500" style="margin-top: 0.5%;">
        
    <br><br>
    
        <li>Create a new folder ‘Final’ - here, we should put all the partner reports once confirmed (if necessary, we first do the unnecessary in column 0 with a minus number and we update the pivot table)</li>
    </ul>
        
    <br> 
        
    <h3><strong><u>CS Process</u></strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the deadline, once we are sure about the values, we start issuing the actual under-consumed POs in Salesforce</li>
        <li>We go to the contract that was under-consumed and we check:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Contract-Products to see which one is under-consumed; there might be more than one (keep this info in mind as you will need it when creating the WW for The-Network)</li>
                <li>The Contract-Countries to see if the country The Network.1 is included</li>
                <li>If yes, we check if there is WW linked to the contract and if yes, we need to edit it and tag the 'never expire' field</li>
            </ul>
        <li>If the C-C or the WW are not linked to the contract, we open the customer in a seperated tab and check if there is an existing WW for The-Network</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If yes, we clone it (take the latest one) &amp; answer it as Done (in case there are several under-consumed CPs, we need to mark it as 'never expire' as well!!!)</li>
                <li>If no, we create new Account-Country, The Network.1 (it does not matter what you put as info into centralization, etc.), and answer it as Done (in case there are several under-consumed CPs, we need to mark it as 'never expire' as well!!!)</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Remember:</strong> In both cases, you should add a comment to the WW indicating this is for under-consumption excercise, ex: ‘Invoicing of 10% of under consumed credits for 01/01/2022 - 30/06/2022 exercise.’</li>
        <br>
        <li>We then go back to the under-consumed contract &amp; add The Network as Contract Country (unless it alraedy exists)</li>
        <li><strong>Attention:</strong> In case the under-consumed contract was a SJNWW, we have to create a new contract, or we can use some other existing contract instead</li>
        <li>We create a new C-P:</li>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>Product - 'Under Consumption Pass-Through'</li>
                <li>Country – The Network.1</li>
                <li>Receiving partner: The-Network</li>
                <li>Number of products: 1</li>
                <li>Total value – taken from the partner final file (i.e., PO248595)</li>
                <li>Add the following comment, ex: ‘Invoicing of 10% of under consumed credits for 01/01/2022 - 30/06/2022 exercise.’</li>
            </ul>
        <li>In case there were several under-consumed CPs under the same contract, we create a new CP for each entry</li>
        <li>We create an ad-hoc PO (in case of several CPs, we can consolidate all of them in ONE single PO) with 1 month duration:</li>
            <ul class='nested'>
                <li>We mark a check box: Under-consumption PO</li>
                <li>We add POLI with the same comment as per above</li>
                <li>We submit and validate the PO</li>
                <li>We open the OUT PO, and we mark a check box as ‘Under-consumption PO’ <strong>manually</strong></li>
                <li>We validate the OUT PO</li>
            </ul>
            
    <br>

        <li>Once we have all POs done and validated, then we need to check that all is correct and we check it in the following report <a href="https://thenetwork.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O07000000JnUBEA0/view?queryScope=userFolders" target="_blank" target="_blank">‘Underconsumption POs created check’</a></li>
        <li>We match the total of this report with the total of POs in xls sheet (for IN_POs and OUT_POs)</li>
        <li>Once these numbers match, then underconsumption process is complete and Finance team is informed, so that these new numbers could be included in the next closing</li>
    </ul>
        
    <br>
    
    <h3><strong><u>Finance Process</u></strong></h3>
    <ul class="none">
        <li>The closing is done in the same way as always. After we have completed the closing files and all numbers are correct, then we are issuing underconsumption xls file as a separate doc for Bastian (ex, it will be called: ‘20220731_Underconsumption POs.xlsx’)</li>
        <li>From the final closing file (20220731_Invoice information with Total Net.xlsx), we create a copy of it with the following modifications: we hide ‘Stepstone to Network’, Network to StepStone’, Invoices NW to Partners’</li>
            <ul class="nested">
                <li>We unhide a new sheet called: ‘Invoices Under Consumption’ + ‘Report’. And we call it ‘20220731_Underconsumption POs.xlsx’</li>
                <li>In the pivot filters of the table, we choose Under Consumption PO: 1</li>
                <li>In the pivot filters of the table, we choose Purchase  Order: record type: In</li>
                <li>We re-refresh the table and save the file as ‘20220731_Underconsumption POs.xlsx’</li>
            </ul>
        <li>We send this file to Bastian, informing him that he needs to issue additional invoices to our partners. Once we receive them, we send them to our partners</li>
        <li>Here is an example of email to Bastian:</li>
