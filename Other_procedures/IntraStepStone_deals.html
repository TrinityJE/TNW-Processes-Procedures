<h2>Intra-StepStone deals procedure</h2>

<p>Whenever you treat a quote from one of the Intra-Stepstone countries (AT, BE, DE, LUX, NL) with a product going to another Intra-Stepstone country (AT, BE, DE, LUX, NL), check the following:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Comment in the quote that would indicate this is Intra-Stepstone and if this is a renewal or a new deal for them; check both the "Quote description" and "Internal Info/Remarks/Justification" sections</li>
    <li>With/or without the comment being present, check our system and see if this is indeed the first time that we are recording such a transaction. <b>IMPORTANT!</b> This goes even for existing customers! It might be that there is international business recorded, but the Intra-Stepstone is not</li>
    <li>In case this is either a new customer or such a business was never recorded in the past, follow this process:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>In the CPQ it is stated that this is "renew" -> mark the CP as Intra-StepStone</li>
        <li>In the CPQ it is states that this is "new" -> do NOT mark the CP as Intra-StepStone</li>
        <li>In the CPQ there is no indication if this is "renew" or "new":</li>
        <ul class="nested2">
            <li>The CP is under 10K total net value -> mark the CP as Intra-StepStone</li>
            <li>The CP is over 10K total net value -> check with SGO to get the information about "renew" or "new" and once you have this information, follow one of the steps above accordingly</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
