<h2>Intra-StepStone deals procedure</h2>

<p>Whenever you treat a quote from one of the Intra-Stepstone countries (AT, BE, DE, LUX, NL) with a product going to another Intra-Stepstone country (AT, BE, DE, LUX, NL), check the following:</p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Comment in the quote that would indicate this is Intra-Stepstone and if this is a renewal or a new deal for them</li>
    <li>With/or without the comment being present, check our system and see if this is indeed the first time that we are recording such a transaction. <b>IMPORTANT!</b> This goes even for existing customers! It might be that there is international business recorded, but the Intra-Stepstone is not</li>
    <li>If that’s the case (this is either a new customer or such a business was never recorded in the past), check the product value:</li>
    <ul class="nested">
        <li>If the product value is lower than 10K, and unless it is specified in the comment in CPQ that this is a new deal for them, go to the CP and mark it as “Intra-StepStone”; if it is specified that it is a new deal for them, you do not have to mark the checkbox</li>
        <li>If the product value is higher than 10K, and the comment does NOT specify if this is renew or new for them, check with SGO to get that information. If it is <b>new</b>, you do not have to mark the checkbox. If this is <b>renew</b>, go to the CP and mark it as “Intra-StepStone”</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
