<h2><span style="color: #8B6DEA;">Workmotion Process</span></h2>
<h3><b><u>Lead sent from Workmotion to The Network:</u></b></h3>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Lead from Workmotion will be sent to <a href="mailto:sales@the-network.com"><u>sales@the-network.com</u></a> and then forwarded to <a href="mailto:cs@the-network.com"><u>cs@the-network.com</u></a>(CS will range it into a special color for Workmotion)</li>
    <li>The lead should contain the following: </li>
        <ul class='nested'>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Phone</li>
            <li>Email</li>
            <li>Country where the person is based (for us the partner to whom we should send the lead) </li>
            <li>If they already have a working relationship (KM: with whom, us or Workmotion?) </li>
            <li>Countries of interest</li>
            <li>Other comments</li>
        </ul>
    <li>The Network to check SF and see if the customer already exists or not:</li>
        <ul class="nested"> 
            <li> If yes, The Network to inform Constantin via email <a href="mailto:constantin.michel@workmotion.com"><u>(constantin.michel@workmotion.com)</u></a> that this is already an existing customer of The Network</li>
                <ul class="nested2">
                    <li>Still, The Network should check if the countries of interest are the countries the customer is currently using (by checking the most current contract) and if not, The Network should send an email to the selling partner with ‘an upsell’ opportunity</li>
                </ul>
            <li>If no, The Network to create a lead in SF and send it to the corresponding partner</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Once the lead is sent, it should be included to an Excel document that should contain information about all received and sent leads (KM: once created, we should put a link to it here)</li>
    <li>At the beginning (Q3-Q4 2022 minimum), The Network should review the leads received from Workmotion and sent to partners at least <b><u>twice per month </u></b>(15th and 30th)</li>
    <li>If lead on ‘Lost’, include it into a communication to Cara (once a month) for their info</li>
    <li>If lead on ‘Won’, check if the lead was converted into account (DO NOT forget to search for the customer’s name in case the lead was not converted as some people do not convert and they simply create a brand-new account)</li>
        <ul class="nested"> 
            <li>If no account yet, simple include this info into the communication to Cara (TNW to check such a lead regularly when checking the Excel document)</li>
            <li>If account already created but there is no contract yet, simply include this info into the communication to Cara (TNW to check such an account regularly when checking the Excel document)</li>
            <li>If account already created and contract as well, few things should be done:</li> 
                <ul class='nested2'> 
                    <li> Check the contract total net value and calculate 10% out of it</li>
                    <li> Go to the CP and mark the CP as ‘Workmotion’ (KM: the field is not yet created, will do so asap and include a screenshot + we need to create a report for follow up on this &amp; procedure for the team – I will take care of that)</li>
                    <li>Include the 10% value that Workmotion can invoice us in the communication to Cara</li>
                    <li>Follow up this account closely to ensure that ALL POs have the 10% passthrough (see below for Intra Stepstone POs Procedure)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <li>What should the communication to Cara look like? </li>
        <ul class="nested"> 
            <li> Include the customer’s name, the lead reference, the lead status, and when the lead is converted also the contract reference, the total net contract value, and the 10% they can invoice us</li>
            <li> Mention that we expect them to send their invoice to <a href="mailto:finance@the-network.com">finance@the-network.com</a> and that it should include an invoice and VAT number, it should be in EURO and the contract reference we provided them with should be in the breakdown of the invoice</li>
        </ul>
        
    <br>
    <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b>(to check with Bastien asap) We will be receiving invoice from an external party, and we will not have any Purchase Orders to match the invoice against. Is it enough that we match it against a Contract-Product where we have the total net value from which we calculated the 10% Workmontion is invoicing us for? (KM: This is the solution we would prefer)</li>
        <ul class="nested"> 
            <li>If not, we could provide PO in some cases (ad-hoc products) immediately and in the rest of the cases at the end of the contract duration (in case of GFP and multiple POs)</li>
            <li>Eventually, we could also create a fake CP to create the PO for the 10% passthrough and have it immediately but this approach means that we are duplicating values and we would like to avoid it</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<p>For <b>Intra StepStone POs procedure (for first international contract that were sold thanks to the lead from Workmotion)</b></p>
<ul class='none'>
    <li>Each CS person should check the following report (KM: link here once created) on the last day of the month minimum (can be check more regularly for lowering the workload) to see if there are any POs that do NOT have the 10% Network passthrough</li>
    <li> If yes, these POs needs to be modified to include the 10% (split 90 seller / 0 receiver /10 TNW) and the receiving partner inform about that change (especially if the PO was already validated!)</li>
    <li>Before closing on the 1st of every month, the report should be rechecked by the person responsible for the closing to ensure that all POs were corrected</li>
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Leads sent from The Network to Workmotion:</u></b></h3>
<ul class="none">
    <li><a href="mailto:sales@the-network.com"><u>sales@the-network.com</u></a> will receive leads for Workmotion from:</li>
        <ul class="nested">
            <li>TNW partners via the Pricing Tool or The Hub (they are using a link where they already book an appointment with Workmotion and when sent, a copy is sent to TNW as well); Sales will forward this email to <a href="mailto:cs@the-network.com"><u>cs@the-network.com</u></a> (CS will range it into a special color for Workmotion</li>
            <li> Other customers who visit our website and fill in a simple form to get further information about Workmotion; Sales will forward tis email to Cara and will put <a href="mailto:cs@the-network.com"><u>cs@the-network.com</u></a> in CC (CS will range it into a special color for Workmotion)</li>
        </ul>
    <li>The Network will then create a lead in SF using the information received from Sales</li>
        <ul class='nested'>
            <li>The lead should be ‘Sent From’ the partner who created the lead (in case the lead came from the website, then the partner will be The Network)</li>
            <li>The ‘Sent To’ should be always Workmotion</li>
            <li>The customer’s name should be always in this format: Customer name (Workmotion)</li>
        </ul> 
    <li>Workmotion should send us a regular report (KM: let’s agree once a month as well as we will do it once a month?) to confirm which leads they received from us were converted or not (we should put those leads that did not convert into ‘Lost’ status).</li>
    <li>For those leads that were converted successfully, TNW should:</li>
        <ul class='nested'> 
            <li> Put the lead in ‘Won’</li>
            <li> Convert the lead</li>
            <li> Create Account-Country for the partner who sent the lead and for The Network (in case it came from the website, only The Network will be needed)</li>
            <li> Answer the WWs as Done</li>
            <li> Create a ‘New’ 12-months contact (no agency, no discounts) including both countries </li>
            <li> Create the first CP</li>
                <ul class="nested2">
                    <li> Receiver: the partner who sent the lead (in case of website lead, it would be The Network)</li>
                    <li> Product: Other</li>
                    <li>Price: 700€ </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Create the PO</li>
            <li> Invoice it to Workmotion as a regular PO</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Once Workmotion confirms (normally at the end of the contract), TNW should create a second CP with the amount provided by Workmotion (product other again) with The Network as the receiver and create the PO</li>
</ul>
